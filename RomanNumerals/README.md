## Roman Numerlas

The Romans were a clever bunch.

# Part I

The Kata says you should write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: eg.

```
1 --> I
10 --> X
7 --> VII
```
Reference: [Rules of Roman numbers](http://www.novaroma.org/via_romana/numbers.html)

# Part II

Write a function to convert in the other direction, ie numeral to digit.
